# Welcome

This is my page where I share knowledge, this book contains mostly stuff about appsec that may be helpful for bug bounty hunters out there.

Everything written in here and in the following pages was acquired by reading articles, books, watching videos and talks. None of this is exclusive, if you want to copy, feel free.

If chit-chat is needed: `felipecaon[at]gmail[dot]com`
