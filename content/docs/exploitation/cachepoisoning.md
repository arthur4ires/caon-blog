# Cache Poisoning

Check if the server is caching requests. You can tellby looking the headers and looking fot the word "HIT".

## If application does not have login function:

Add an unknown header value to force the page get 400 cached result

```
GET /home HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
\:
```

## If application has login function:

Login into an account and find a page that returns sensitive information.
Add cachable extension (.js, .css) to the url. Extension FUZZ works here.

```
GET /home/.js HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
```

Open the malformed URL in browser as unauthenticated user and grab results. Or use Curl.
