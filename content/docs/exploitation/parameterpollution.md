# HTTP Parameter Pollution

When searching for HPP keep in mind some servers handle parameters differently.

Take `http://example.com?username=foo&username=bar` as an example. 
- PHP and Apache use the last username occurence. 
- Tomcat uses the first occurence. 
- ASP and IIS user all occurences

## Social Media Share Links

Often a websites offers its user a feature to share a given page in social media. The fearture works this way: An user clicks the share button and a pop-ip page shows the message and action button that the user click uses to share content.

Amost always the original link from the site is reflected in the request.

We can use HPP to leverage this function to overwrite shared content:

1) Find a page with a share feature
2) Choose Twitter (as an example)
3) Replace the URL from `example.com/cool-article` to `example.com/cool-article?text=; Visit https://evil.com`
4) Load the the new URL and click the share button
5) The user will now share a tweet with `<original_message>; Visit https://evil.com`
