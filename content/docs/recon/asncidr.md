# ASN

An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique identifier that allows its autonomous system to exchange routing information with other systems.

The five regional Internet registries are:

    African Network Information Center (AFRINIC)
    American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
    Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)
    Latin American and Caribbean Network Information Centre (LACNIC)
    Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)
